# Data Visualization Project in Excel  
> (followed a FreeCodeCamp.org tutorial called 'Data Analysis Bootcamp' hosted by 'Alex the Analyst')

Reformated the data in the Excel columns so that they were more readable. For example, changing 'M' and 'S' to 'Married' and 'Single' so that you don't have to guess what the single letters stand for. Used the information to create pivot tables and then used those pivot tables to create a dashboard with filters.
